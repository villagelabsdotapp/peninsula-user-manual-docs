title: "Peninsula User Manual"
description: "Operational guide for Peninsula with a reusable standard model and an EBLG-specific implementation profile."
---

## Purpose

This documentation package is structured in two layers:

1. A reusable Peninsula operating manual for any client implementation.
2. An EBLG-specific profile that captures scope, controls, and decisions.

It reflects the key board-level concerns raised by Kevin Long and Erica: openness, exportability, integration readiness, privacy boundaries, and practical phased rollout.
