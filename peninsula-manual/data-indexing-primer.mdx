## 1) Data Pool: What We Expect from EBLG

Likely source systems and stores:

- DMS and matter repositories
- Email archives and matter correspondence
- Shared drives and OneDrive folders
- Meeting transcripts and call notes
- Structured exports from CRM/accounting/workflow systems
- External legal reference sources (where licensed/approved)

Common file types:

- Documents: `PDF`, `DOCX`, `TXT`
- Spreadsheets: `XLSX`, `CSV`
- Email: `MSG`, `EML`, mailbox exports
- Structured data: `JSON`, `CSV`
- Scans/images needing OCR (only when warranted)

## 2) First-Principles Filter: Use / Hold / Exclude

For each incoming asset, we decide:

1. Should this data be included at all?
2. If included, how deeply should it be processed?
3. What retrieval value do we expect from processing it?

Base filter dimensions:

- Relevance to real EBLG workflows
- Citation value and source reliability
- Confidentiality fit and permission enforceability
- Processing cost vs expected utility
- Redundancy (duplicate or superseded content)

## 3) Selective Processing Logic (Efficiency)

Default policy is not maximum processing. Default policy is sufficient processing.

- `L0 Catalog`: metadata only for inventory and lineage
- `L1 Parse`: standard text extraction and structural metadata
- `L2 Selective OCR`: OCR only when extraction quality is poor and file value is high
- `L3 Enrichment`: entity/relation/workflow tagging for high-value corpus

OCR policy:

- Do not OCR all PDFs by default.
- OCR when extraction confidence or usable text coverage falls below threshold.
- Prefer page-level OCR over full-document OCR.
- Prioritize OCR budget on high-query, high-value assets.

## 4) Index Data Question: What It Means

"Index data" means creating retrieval structures that make future queries fast, relevant, and source-grounded.

Peninsula uses a hybrid approach:

- Lexical index: exact and near-exact keyword match
- Vector index: semantic similarity and concept-level retrieval
- Metadata index: filters such as matter, client, date, confidentiality tier, document type

Why hybrid indexing:

- Lexical catches exact legal terms/citations.
- Vector catches conceptually similar language.
- Metadata enforces policy and narrows noise.

## 5) Phased Indexing Strategy

Recommended rollout:

- Baseline index high-value historical corpus first.
- Turn on forward incremental indexing for new content.
- Backfill older/long-tail data only when retrieval analytics justify it.

Why this beats "index everything now":

- Lower initial cost and faster time-to-value.
- Better control over confidentiality and quality.
- Decisions guided by observed query misses instead of assumptions.

## 6) Search -> Retrieval -> Agent Workflow

Request flow:

1. User asks question or launches a workflow.
2. Retriever applies ACL + metadata filters.
3. Hybrid retrieval returns candidate chunks/cards.
4. Ranker assembles citation-backed context.
5. LLM/agent produces draft output with references.
6. Human review gate approves, edits, or rejects.

## 7) What We Can Do with the Data

Once indexed and governed, Peninsula can support:

- Faster drafting of memos, diligence summaries, and transaction analyses
- Cross-matter pattern detection and precedent reuse
- Source-cited Q&A over internal corpus
- Structured exports and reporting for governance and board oversight
- Agent-assisted workflows with explicit human checkpoints

## 8) Simple Decision Rule

Process deeper only when expected retrieval quality or workflow leverage justifies it, while preserving security, auditability, and portability.
