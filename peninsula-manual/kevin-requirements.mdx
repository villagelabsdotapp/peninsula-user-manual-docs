## What Kevin and Erica Are Asking For

From the provided email screenshots, the core asks are consistent:

- Avoid black-box lock-in; require open integration and practical exit paths.
- Prove exportability (especially usable CSV/JSON and lineage-preserving records).
- Treat Peninsula as a knowledge layer over systems of record, not a replacement for core practice-management systems.
- Use private AI with retrieval-grounded outputs, citations, and mandatory human review.
- Define indexing policy clearly, including the question of retro-indexing vs phased indexing.
- Clarify how confidentiality boundaries, permissions, and workflow segregation are enforced.
- Show concrete workflow utility (drafting, diligence, analysis, cross-checking, CRM/ops support) without over-committing to custom modules.

## Traceability Map

| Concern | Manual Coverage | Implementation Signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Openness over black box | `standard-manual` Sections 2, 12 | Documented APIs/connectors, webhooks, export package definition |
| Non-negotiables rubric | `standard-manual` Section 2.2 | Go/no-go scorecard during onboarding |
| No custom core PM rebuild | `standard-manual` Sections 2.3, 15.2 | Custom modules explicitly phased and approved |
| Private AI + RAG + review | `standard-manual` Sections 2.4, 9, 10, 11 | Citation-backed retrieval + human gate |
| Indexing strategy clarity | `standard-manual` Section 8, `eblg-profile` Section 21 | Hybrid baseline + incremental + targeted backfill |
| Confidentiality & permissions | `standard-manual` Section 11, `eblg-profile` Sections 18, 20 | ACL propagation, matter-level restrictions, audit trails |
| Export and portability | `standard-manual` Section 12 | Tested export runbook and periodic portability drill |

## Open Questions Still Requiring EBLG Decision

- Exact confidentiality tiers and restricted matters/personas.
- Final usefulness score thresholds and OCR trigger thresholds.
- Initial source connectors authorized for production.
- Definition of the board governance export package.
- Which advanced workflow modules are phase 1 vs phase 2.

## Practical Recommendation

Use the manual as the baseline contract for architecture and controls, and treat custom modules as separately governed workstreams with explicit acceptance criteria.
